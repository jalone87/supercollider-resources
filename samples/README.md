# Samples Folder

This is a folder with a strict expectation of structure.


- There should be one layer of subfolders, 
- and ALL the sample MUST be inside the subfolders
- samples shall benamed in a way that is compatible with variables names, so avoid punctuation and spaces. start with a letter. use only 09AZaz_

Using the standard template and `makeBuffer` function the samples will be automatically loaded in the buffers.
